On my browser, under "New Issue" the attachment "Optional Decription" is pushing out the right side of the screen creating a horizontal scroll which makes the "private" button invisible unless scrolled to. This is because optional description has width 60, which is the same width as the description, however there's a lot more stuff on the left.
